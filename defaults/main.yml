# Default: GitLab Runner reads system certificate store and verifies the GitLab
# server against the CA's stored in system.
# GitLab Runner reads the PEM (DER format is not supported) certificate from
# predefined file:
#   - `/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/hostname.crt` on *nix systems when gitlab-runner
#     is executed as root.
#   - `~/.gitlab-runner/certs/hostname.crt` on *nix systems when gitlab-runner
#     is executed as non-root,
#   - `./certs/hostname.crt` on other systems.
#
# If address of your server is: `https://my.gitlab.server.com:8443/`.
# Create the certificate file at:
#   - `/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/my.gitlab.server.com.crt`.
# GitLab Runner exposes tls-ca-file option during registration and in
# config.toml which allows you to specify custom file with certificates. This
# file will be read everytime when runner tries to access the GitLab server.

# Please override this variable when calling the role.
# Do NOT copy your certificate or key in this file.
# It is your responsability to check that the `ssl_certificate` has no errors.
